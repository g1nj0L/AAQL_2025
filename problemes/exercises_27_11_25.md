# EXERCISES

For the evaluation of this unit, the student is asked to solve the following problem using the above Python Notebooks.

* Problem 0. Create a script that generates random data from different distributions. Compare:
    - A normal or Gaussian distribution for different values of the variance and mean
    - A uniformly random distribution
    - The beta distribution.
* Problem 1. Estimate and compare the confidence intervals or error bars obtained for each distribution using Hoeffding's inequality and the Chebyshev inequality (for the latter one, you need to analyze or empirically  estimate the variance). 
* Problem 2. When possible, compare your results to theoretical values.
* Problem 3. For which distributions does the [68–95–99.7 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule) hold?
